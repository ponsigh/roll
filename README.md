Development of a CNC

Development of a 5 axis CNC. Design competition is encouraged and multiple ideas and design are appreciated.

The aim of the project is to make available a CNC with little price barrier. Time is of the essence, rough designs are welcome, please no not feel the need to refine your designs.

The end goal is a 5 axis cnc for hard metals, which can be made from parts easily found.
